## My process
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During the process, I learned that I need to start doing tons of challenges and projects.  
I realized that hundreds of tutorials/videos/articles can only give me nothing without building anything on my own.  
I estimated 35 mins for this newbie challenge, but I ended up spending almost 6 hours on this.  
I was disappointed and frustrated, but I knew this is what I should feel to be better. 

### Continued development

HTML
- Use better semantic element

CSS
- Organize CSS 
- Replace hard-coded margin top/bottom value(i.e. 12em)
- Try flexbox
- Select better color for link hover and active state


And the main element would become too small when resizing the window, better solution is needed.

### Useful resources

- [Drop shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter-function/drop-shadow) - Nice effect.
